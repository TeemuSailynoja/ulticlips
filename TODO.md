# To Do

1. ~In [src/process_annotations.py](src/process_annotations.py), we would need to have functionality for changing the format produced to annotations/output into the format specified in [games_datamodel.md](games_datamodel.md).~
   - ~Any missing fields, except point start and point end should probably be allowed for points.~
2. ~Try out splitting the demo.mp4 into points with this functionality.~
3. Be happy!
4. Think of the next steps for the project.
